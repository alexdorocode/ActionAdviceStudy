# ActionAdviceStudy
This project adapts the Introspective Action Advising (IAA) algorithm for a DQN agent, applying it to transfer knowledge from a simpler to a more complex NES Super Mario level. By evaluating task similarity's effect on IAAâ€™s effectiveness, we lay groundwork for future multi-agent research on adaptive action advisory systems.
